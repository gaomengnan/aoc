#+title: Array Pair Sum Divisibility Problem

*** Description

Given an array of integers nums and a number k, write a function that returns true if given array can be divided into pairs such that sum of every pair is divisible by k.

*** Examples
#+begin_example
Input: arr[] = [9, 5, 7, 3], k = 6
Output: true
Explanation: {(9, 3), (5, 7)} is a possible solution. 9 + 3 = 12 is divisible by 6 and 7 + 5 = 12 is also divisible by 6.
