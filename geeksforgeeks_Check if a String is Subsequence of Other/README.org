** Check if a String is Subsequence of Other

*** Description

Given two strings s1 and s2. You have to check that s1 is a subsequence of s2 or not.
Note: A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.



*** Examples

#+begin_example
Input: s1 = "AXY", s2 = "YADXCP"
Output: false
Explanation: s1 is not a subsequence of s2 as 'Y' appears before 'A'.
#+end_example

#+begin_src python
class Solution:
    def isSubSeq(self, s1, s2):
        i = 0

        j = 0

        while i < len(s1) and j < len(s2):
            if s1[i] == s2[j]:
                i += 1
                j +=1
            else:
                j += 1

        return i == len(s1)


print(Solution().isSubSeq("AXY", "YADXCP"))
print(Solution().isSubSeq("gksrek", "geeksforgeeks"))
#+end_src
