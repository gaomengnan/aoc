** Container With Most Water

*** 描述

Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers, where each element arr[i] represents the height of the vertical lines, find the maximum amount of water that can be contained between any two lines, together with the x-axis.

Note: In the case of a single vertical line it will not be able to hold water.

*** 示例

Input: arr[] = [1, 5, 4, 3]
Output: 6
Explanation: 5 and 3 are 2 distance apart. So the size of the base is 2. Height of container = min(5, 3) = 3. So, total area to hold water = 3 * 2 = 6.

Input: arr[] = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]
Output: 12
Explanation: 5 and 3 are 4 distance apart. So the size of the base is 4. Height of container = min(5, 3) = 3. So, total area to hold water = 4 * 3 = 12.

#+begin_src python
class Solution:
    def maxWater(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)
        ans = 0
        s, f = 0, n - 1

        while s < f:
            ans = max(ans, (f - s) * min(arr[s], arr[f]))

            if arr[s] < arr[f]:
                s += 1
            else:
                f -= 1

        return ans
