** Count the triplets

Given an array arr, count the number of distinct triplets (a, b, c) such that:

a + b = c

Each triplet is counted only once, regardless of the order of a and b.

** Examples:

**Input**: arr[] = [1, 5, 3, 2]
**Output**: 2
**Explanation**: There are 2 triplets: 1 + 2 = 3 and 3 +2 = 5
