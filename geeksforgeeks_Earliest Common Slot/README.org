* Question

** Earliest Common Slot

*** Description

You are given two lists of availability time slots, slots1 and slots2, for two people. Each slot is represented as [start, end], and it is gurranted that within each list, no two slots overlap (i.e., for any two intervals, either start1>end2 or start2>end1). Given a metting duration d, return the earliest common time slot of length of least d. If no such slot exits, return an empty array.


*** Examples

#+begin_example
Input: slots1 = [[10,50], [60,120], [140,210]], slots2 = [[0,15], [60,70]], d = 8
Output: [60,68]
Explanation: The only overlap is [60,70] (10 minutes), which is enough for an 8-minute meeting, so answer is [60,68]
