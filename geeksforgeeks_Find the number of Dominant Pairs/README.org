* Find the number of Dominant Pairs
Given an even-sized array arr[] of length n. A dominant pair (i, j) is defined as:

i belongs to the first half of the array, (0 <= i < n/2)
j belongs to the second half of the array, (n/2 <= j < n)
The value at index i is at least five times the value at index j, (arr[i] >= 5 * arr[j])

The task is to find the count of total number of dominant pairs in the array.
