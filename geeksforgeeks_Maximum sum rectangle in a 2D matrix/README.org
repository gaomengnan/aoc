#+title: Maximum sum rectangle in a 2D matrix

*** Description

Given a 2D matrix mat[][] of integers, find the submatrix (i.e., a rectangular section of the matrix) that has the maximum possible sum among all possible submatrices.

*** Examples
#+begin_example
Input: mat[][] = [[1, 2, -1, -4, -20],
                            [-8, -3, 4, 2, 1],
                           [3, 8, 10, 1, 3],
                          [-4, -1, 1, 7, -6]]
Output: 29
Explanation: The matrix is as follows and the green rectangle denotes the maximum sum rectangle which is equal to 29.
