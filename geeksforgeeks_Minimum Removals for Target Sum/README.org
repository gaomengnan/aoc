* Question
** Minimum Removals for Target Sum

*** Description

You are given an array of positive integers arr[] and an integer k. In one operation, you can remove either the leftmost or the rightmost element from the array. After each operation, the size of arr[] will be reduced by one.
You have to determine the minimum number of operations required to make the total sum of removed elements exactly equal to k. If it is not possible to achieve this, return -1.

*** Examples

#+begin_example
Input: arr[] = [3, 4, 1, 3, 2], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Removing 3 from left and 2 from right gives a sum of 5 in 2 operations.
