** Row with Max 1s

*** Description

Given a 2D binary matrix mat[][] of size n x m, where each row contains only 0s and 1s, and each row is sorted in non-decreasing order (all the 0s come before any 1s).
Find the index of the row that contains the highest number of 1s.

Note: If multiple rows have the same maximum count of 1s, return the row with the smallest index.

*** Examples

Input: mat[][] = [[0, 0, 1, 1],
                [0, 1, 1, 1],
                [0, 0, 0, 1]]
Output: 1
