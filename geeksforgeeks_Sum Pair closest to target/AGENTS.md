# Agent Guidelines

## Build/Lint/Test Commands
- Run the main script: `python main.py`
- No formal test framework - examples are included at the bottom of main.py
- No linting commands configured

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use Python class-based solutions with `Solution` class
- Method names use camelCase (e.g., `sumClosest`)
- Variable names use camelCase (e.g., `topSum`, `left`, `right`)
- Include print statements for debugging during development
- Sort arrays before processing when needed
- Handle edge cases (e.g., single element arrays return empty list)
- Use two-pointer technique for array problems
- Return results in ascending order as specified
